# Barrier

## General

There is quite a bit to be added to our wiki here on GitHub. As time permits and as the project progresses we will be adding bits of information to the wiki. For now we wanted to share our binary downloads for stable builds. Stay tuned for more!

## Binary Downloads

### Windows
*Note:* If you do not have it already then you must install the [VC++ 2017 Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x64.exe) before installing Barrier. This will be automated in the future once we replace the horrible WiX installer :)

[v1.9 - Windows x64 - MSI](http://debauchee.atwebpages.com/download/Barrier-v1.9.msi)
