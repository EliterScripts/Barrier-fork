# Barrier

## General

There is quite a bit to be added to our wiki here on GitHub. As time permits and as the project progresses we will be adding bits of information to the wiki. For now we wanted to share our binary downloads for stable builds. Stay tuned for more!

## Binary Downloads

### Windows
**Option 1:** Use the older, dumber, WiX installer. If you do not have it already then you must install the [VC++ 2017 Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x64.exe) before installing Barrier. 

[v1.9 - Windows x64 - MSI](http://debauchee.atwebpages.com/download/Barrier-v1.9.msi)

**Option 2:** Try the **BETA** non-WiX installer which will automagically download and install the VC++ runtime for you if needed. If you use this installer and have trouble with it please [add a PR](../../issues) (if there isn't one for your issue already) so we can fix it.
